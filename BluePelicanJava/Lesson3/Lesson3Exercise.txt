Exercise on Lesson 3

1. Write code in which a String variable s contains “The number of rabbits is”. An integer variable argh has a value of 129. Concatenate these variables into a String called report. Then print report. The printout should yield:
	The number of rabbits is 129.
Note that we want a period to print after the 9.

String s = “The number of rabbits is”;
int argh = 129;
String report = s + “ ” + argh + “.”;
System.out.println( report );

2. What is the output of     System.out.pirntln( p.toUpperCase( ) );   if p = “Groovy Dude”?

GROOVY DUDE

3. Write code that will assign the value of “Computer Science is for nerds” to the String variable g. Then have it print this String with nothing but “small” letters.

String g = “Computer Science is for nerds”;
System.out.println( g.toLowerCase( ) );

4. What will be the value of c?
	String c;
	String m = “The Gettysburg Address”;
	c = m.substring(4);

“Gettysburg Address”

5. What will be the value of c?
	String b = “Four score and seven years ago,”;
	String c = b.substring(7, 12);

“ore a”

6. What is the value of count?
	int count;
	String s = “Surface tension”;
	count = s.length( );

15
7. Write code that will look at the number of characters in String m = “Look here!”; and then print
      “Look here!” has 10 characters.
	Use the length( ) method to print the 10 …you must also force the two quotes to print.
	
	String m = “Look here!”;
	System.out.println( “\“” + m + “\” has ” + m.length( ) + “ characters.” );

8. How would you print the following?
All “good” men should come to the aid of their country.
	
	System.out.println( “All \“good\” men should come to the aid of their country. );

9. Write code that will produce the following printout using only a single println( ).

System.out.println( “Hello\nHello again” );

10. Write code that will produce the following printout.
A backslash looks like this \, …right?
	
	System.out.println( “A backslash looks like this \\, …right?” );

11. What is the output by the following?
String pq = “Eddie Haskel”;
int hm = pq.length( );
String ed = pq.substring(hm - 4);
System.out.println(ed);
	
	skel

12. Which character is at the 5th index in the String “Herman Munster”?
