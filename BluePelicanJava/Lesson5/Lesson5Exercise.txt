Exercise on Lesson 5

Unless otherwise instructed in the following problems, state what gets printed.

1. Write code that will create a constant E that’s equal to 2.718.

final double E = 2.718;

2. Write the simplest type constant that sets the number of students, NUM_STUDENTS, to 236.

final int NUM_STUDENTS = 236;

3. What’s wrong, if anything, with the following code in the main method?
final double Area;
Area = 203.49;
	
	There is nothing wrong with this code.

4. int cnt = 27.2;
System.out.println(cnt);
What’s printed?

The code will not compile.

5. double d = 78.1;
int fg = (int)d;
System.out.println(fg);
What’s printed?

78

6. Is   double f4 = 22;  legal?

Yes

7. The following code stores a 20 in the variable j:
double j = 61/3;
What small change can you make to this single line of code to make it produce the “real” answer to the division?

double j = 61/3.0;

8. System.out.println( (double)(90/9) );

10.0

9. System.out.println(4 + 6.0/4 + 5 * 3 - 3);

17.5

10. int p = 3;
double d = 10.3;
int j = (int)5.9;
System.out.println(p + p * d - 3 * j);

18.9

11. int p = 3;
double d = 10.3;
int j = (int)5.9;
System.out.println(p + p * (int)d - 3 * j);

18

The following code applies to 12 – 15:

	int dividend = 12, divisor = 4, quotient = 0, remainder = 0;
	int dividend2 = 13, divisor2 = 3, quotient2 = 0, remainder = 0;
	quotient = dividend / divisor;
	remainder = dividend % divisor;
	quotient2 = dividend2 / divisor2;
	remainder2 = dividend2 % divisor2;

12. System.out.println(quotient);

3

13. System.out.println(remainder);

0

14. System.out.println(quotient2);

4

15. System.out.println(remainder2);

1
16. Write a line of code in which you divide the double precision number d by an integer variable called i. Type cast the double so that strictly integer division is done. Store the result in j, an integer.

j = (int) d / i;

17. Suppose we have a line of code that says

Final String M = “ugg”;
	
	Later in the same program, would it be permissible to say the following?
	
		M = “wow”;
	
	No

18. Is the following code legal? If so, what is printed? If not, why?

int k = 7;
k*=.5;
System.out.println(k);
	
	Yes
	3
